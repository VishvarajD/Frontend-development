            <div class="col-8 t-size">Katraj, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a
                286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of architecture in
                the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in
                Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself
                as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an
                area of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the
                city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with its various
                forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that greets the
                visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was
                destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what remains of it is equally
                thrilling and majestic. The Shaniwar Wada, although ridden with tales of
                treachery and deceit, is one of the last standing testimonies to the
                grandeur, valour, and the just rule of the Peshwas. The entire old part of
                the city of Pune is laid out in a chaotic yet ironically, orderly fashion
                all around this historical structure. It is around Shaniwar Wada that you
                will find the oldest markets of Pune including Laxmi Road, Tulshibaug,
                Ravivar Peth etc. It is said that on a full moon night the fort is haunted
                by the ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered in the
                palace by his aunt and uncle - Anandi and Raghunathrao. However, there is
                not a shred of evidence to support such claims. So, you can get a glimpse
                of history and some drama as well! This was after all the site of the
                famed romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of
                the gates has also been named after her!</div>
