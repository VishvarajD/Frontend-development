            <div class="image"><img src="/images/shanivar_Wada.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <div class="desc">Shaniwarwada, once the seat of the Peshwa governance in Pune is a
                286-year-old mansion and is one of the finest examples of architecture in
          the city. It is now one of the most popular tourist destinations in
          Maharashtra. This grand mansion was built by the Peshwa Bajirao I himself
          as the residence of the Peshwas. Although the Wada currently covers an
          area of 625 acres, in its heyday it covered almost the entire area of the
          city itself. The place never fails to amaze the visitor with its various
          forts and fountain, and the majestic statue of Baji Rao I that greets the
          visitor at the entrance of the palace. Although most of the Wada was
          destroyed by an unexplained fire in 1828, what remains of it is equally
          thrilling and majestic. The Shaniwar Wada, although ridden with tales of
          treachery and deceit, is one of the last standing testimonies to the
          grandeur, valour, and the just rule of the Peshwas. The entire old part of
          the city of Pune is laid out in a chaotic yet ironically, orderly fashion
          all around this historical structure. It is around Shaniwar Wada that you
          will find the oldest markets of Pune including Laxmi Road, Tulshibaug,
          Ravivar Peth etc. It is said that on a full moon night the fort is haunted
          by the ghost of a former Peshwa king Narayanrao as he was murdered in the
          palace by his aunt and uncle - Anandi and Raghunathrao. However, there is
          not a shred of evidence to support such claims. So, you can get a glimpse
          of history and some drama as well! This was after all the site of the
          famed romance between Peshwa Bajirao and Mastani Sahiba. In fact, one of
          the gates has also been named after her!</div>
